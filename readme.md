# Simple Image Zoom App

This is my sample react app for a simple image zoom.

## Setup

All the dependencies are listed in package.json so setup should just be a case of running:

```
npm install
```

## Running

To run the project, use the command below. This should launch a webpack build and start the server. You can then visit the site [here](http://localhost:8080).

```
npm start
```

Any problems let me know :)

## Tests

I've included a range of unit tests. These can be run using the command below.

```
npm run test
```

## Source Code Documentation

I've included source code documentation using documentation.js. This can be viewed by opening index.html in the docs directory.
If required the documentation can be automatically regenerated using the command below.

```
npm run documentation
```
